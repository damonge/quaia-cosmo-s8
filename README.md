# Cosmological constraints from Quaia and CMB lensing
This repository hosts code related to the cosmological analysis of the [Quaia quasar sample](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8060754).

For now, it hosts a couple of notebooks showing how to read and interpret the angular power spectra used in [Alonso et al. 2023](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.17748), and how to compute them from the public catalogs. The power spectra and associated metadata are publicly hosted in [zenodo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8098635).

We hope to eventually include the full analysis pipeline used in that paper. In the meantime, we're happy to provide it upon request.

If you make use of these data for any publication, we kindly ask you to cite [our paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.17748).
