# Cosmological constraints from Quaia and CMB lensing
This repository hosts code related to the cosmological analysis of the [Quaia quasar sample](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8060754).

For now, it hosts a notebook showing how to read and interpret the angular power spectra used in Alonso et al. 2023 (link to paper coming soon). These data are publicly hosted in [zenodo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8098635). We hope to eventually include the full analysis pipeline used in that paper. In the meantime, we're happy to provide it upon request.
